# DockerGoTemplateScript
A short, simple script to generate a new Go Docker project. Includes a Dockerfile, and a hello world Go file.

To run, download the file, or copy and paste the contents into a new file called `CreateGoProject.sh`. Then, run `chmod u+x CreateGoProject.sh`. Now you're all set to run the project. Simply run `./CreateGoProject` in your chosen terminal, and follow the on screen instructions. Once successfully created, it will generate the following file structure:

```
.
└── your-project-name/
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── go.mod
    └── /src/
        └── main.go
```
